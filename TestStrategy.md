# Test Strategy: User Registration & KYC Features

Test strategy covers the **User Registration** (Team 1) and **KYC** (Team 2) features of a digital wallet web app. The system involves 4 **internal microservices** and 
an **external KYC vendor** with sandbox constraints. Infrastructure is managed by the **Platform Team**.

---

## 1. Test Types

- **Unit Tests**  
  Validate business logic (e.g. email/phone format, document format/size checks).

- **Integration Tests**  
  Verify interactions between microservices (e.g. User + Identity, Document Upload + external KYC API).

- **End-to-End Tests**  
  Simulate full workflows: registration → login → document upload → KYC result → payments access.

- **Performance Tests**  
  Focus on KYC verification latency and load.

- **Negative Tests**  
  Invalid user data (email, phone, password), duplicate accounts, unsupported documents, failed uploads.

- **Security Tests**  
  Test for secure authentication, data protection, and access control.

## 2. Test Tools / Frameworks

| Test Level     | Tools                    |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Unit / Integration | Jest, TestNG     |
| E2E             | Cypress, Playwright      |
| API             | Postman, REST Assured    |
| Performance     | JMeter                   |
| CI/CD           | GitLab CI, Jenkins |

---

## 3. Microservices Context

- Test each service independently using mocks/stubs where applicable.
- Use service-level health checks during integration and E2E runs.
- Versioning and tagging APIs to support independent deployments and testing.

---

## 4. External Vendor Constraints

- Limited sandbox access:
  - Use real vendor sandbox only for critical test cases.
  - Mock vendor API for local, CI, and most integration tests.
  - Schedule sandbox usage across teams to prevent overload.
  - Implement fallback/test stubs for vendor timeouts and errors.

## 5. Test Environments

| Environment | Purpose                          | Notes                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Dev         | Fast feedback loop               | All external dependencies mocked  |
| Staging     | Pre-prod verification            | Real integrations where possible  |
| Prod        | Live monitoring & smoke tests    | Use feature flags and observability tools (e.g. Grafana) |

---

## 6. Test Data Strategy

- Use synthetic test data for users and documents.
- Anonymize production-like data for staging where allowed.
- Clearly tag test data to avoid polluting shared environments.
- Automate test data creation and cleanup post-run.

---

## 7. Quality Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: ≥ 80% (unit + integration)
- **Test Pass Rate**: ≥ 95% in CI pipelines, 100% for smoke KYC
- **Defect Leakage**: Track issues missed before prod
- **Time to Feedback**: < 10 minutes for pull-request test runs
- **KYC Verification Latency**: 2–20 sec range; monitor timeouts/errors
